#summary How to import AHX and Protracker modules

Currently, only Protracker and AHX modules can be imported. klystrack can't save songs in these formats, however.

It is strongly suggested that the import feature is used only as a basis for a conversion, manual work will be needed in most cases.

=Protracker=

4-32 channel modules are supported. No attempt is made to emulate the instruments as they are sample-based and deducing base notes etc. from sample loop lengths would still be mostly guesswork. 

Some effects are converted but because Protracker works on sample periods and not notes when e.g. pitch bending, the actual speeds will be off.

=AHX=

klystrack attempts to load AHX modules as perfectly as the differences between AHX and klystrack permit. Here are some things that can't be converted perfectly:

  * AHX envelopes are not ADSR like in klystrack, additionally the envelope timing is not perfect
  * AHX noise is a looping sample, in klystrack the noise is generated and does not loop
  * klystrack PWM is oscillator-based while in AHX it works between upper and lower limits
  * There is no automatic filter modulation in klystrack
  * The same precautions apply to portamento etc. as in Protracker
