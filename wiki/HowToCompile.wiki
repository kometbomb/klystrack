#summary How to compile klystrack
#labels Phase-Implementation

  # You need both the source for [http://code.google.com/p/klystron klystron] and the source for klystrack. The directory structure should be something like this:
  {{{
/code/klystron
/code/klystrack
}}}
  # Compile klystron and klystrack (take note you need to compile both projects for e.g. the debug profile)
  # The klystrack makefile should also compile the needed resource file in {{{res/data}}}
  # To deploy, do a {{{make zip}}} for klystrack. {{{zip/data}}} should now contain the files needed to run klystrack (including SDL libraries). 
  # To debug, go to {{{/code/klystrack}}} and do {{{gdb bin.debug/klystrack.exe}}} this is so that klystrack will find the resource file in {{{/code/klystrack/res/data}}}
