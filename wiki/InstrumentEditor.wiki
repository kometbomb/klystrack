#summary How to create instruments and sound effects

The instrument editor view shows parameters that control the sound synthesis and the instrument program editor.

=Instrument program=

When an instrument is triggered, the program starts executing from the beginning. The execution speed is independent from the song speed but relative to the routine update frequency. The program period instrument parameter controls how many routine updates it takes to advance the program one step.

A program modifies the played waveform and can be used to create more interesting sounds. The commands are the same as the [Commands track commands]. This means the program can also be thought as a macro: you do not need to enter the same track commands if the instrument executes has the same commands in the program. 

The program can be edited by moving to the program and pressing return on the instruction you want to edit.

The following example is a simple 0-4-7 major arpeggio:

|| {{{00 00 0000}}} || set arpeggio note to 0 (the same note as played) || 
|| {{{01 01 0004}}} || set arpeggio note to 4 (played note plus 4 semitones) || 
|| {{{02 02 0007}}} || set arpeggio note to 7|| 
|| {{{03 03 ff00}}} || jump back to step 00 || 

Note that you can also specify the arpeggio notes by using the track command {{{10xy}}}. This makes it possible to use the same instrument to play different arpeggio chords. In the program, you can refer to those two notes with {{00f0}} and {{00f1}}. For the above example, the following program and track data achieves the same:

|| {{{00 00 0000}}} || set arpeggio note to 0 (the same note as played) || 
|| {{{01 01 00f0}}} || set arpeggio note to external arpeggio note 0 || 
|| {{{02 02 00f1}}} || set arpeggio note to external arpeggio note 1 || 
|| {{{03 03 ff00}}} || jump back to step 00 || 

And the track data:

{{{
C-4 00 ... 0047
}}}

*Tip:* A handy way to debug instrument programs is to set the program period (execution speed) to 10 or more and then pay attention to the little marker that shows current program tick. That way you'll notice if e.g. a jump doesn't point to the correct command.

==Combining commands==

In the following example, the first three commands are executed inside the same program tick. This can be achieved by entering the commands and pressing space to combine the command with the command below.

|| {{{00 00 000c ,}}} || set arpeggio note to +12 semitones|| 
|| {{{01    0102 |}}} || portamento up by 2/256 semitones|| 
|| {{{02    0710 '}}} || pw down by 10 steps || 
|| {{{03 01 ff00}}} || go to beginning || 

Note how the second column doesn't follow the leftmost column. I.e. when played, all commands are executed at step 00. When the next step (01 in the second column) is executed, it will be the jump command at 03, skipping past the two commands combined with
