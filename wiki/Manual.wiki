==Menu==

Hold right mouse button down to bring up the menu bar. Select the menu option by hovering over it and release right button.

==General keyboard controls==

|| cursor keys || move around/change values ||
|| TAB || change focused element (where applicable) ||
|| F2 || pattern editor || 
|| F3 || instrument editor || 
|| Shift+F3 || reverb editor || 
|| F4 || sequence editor || 
|| Shift+F4 || classic editor || 
|| F5 || play || 
|| F8 || stop || 
|| F9/F10 || octave down/up || 
|| CTRL+n || new song || 
|| CTRL+s/o || save/open relevant data (song in sequence editor, instrument in instrument editor etc.) || 
|| CTRL+c/v / CTRL+ins/SHIFT+ins || copy/paste || 
|| SHIFT+cursor || select || 
|| keypad plus/minus || select instrument || 
|| CTRL+keypad plus/minus || change song speed  || 
|| ALT+keypad plus/minus || change second song speed the two speeds mean the first speed is used for even steps and the other for odd steps. e.g. 8+4 will have a distinct shuffle in the tempo. || 
|| CTRL+F9/F10 || change song player rate (i.e. 50 Hz means every second 50 frames are processed, which would translate to 50/6 steps per second for the default speeds) || 
|| SHIFT+CTRL+F9/F10 || change time signature (only has a visual effect, the spacing of the different colored pattern steps changes) || 
|| CTRL+R || Change screen scaling ||

==Instrument editor==

===Instrument program===

When an instrument is triggered, the program starts executing from the beginning. The execution speed is independent from the song speed but relative to the routine update frequency. 

A program modifies the played waveform and can be used to create more interesting sounds. The commands are the same as the track commands. This means the program can also be thought as a macro: you do not need to enter the same track commands if the instrument executes has the same commands in the program. A practical example would be a complex arpeggio.

The commands generally follow a pattern: the first two digits tell the action and the next two are the parameter(s) for the command. If the most significant bit of a command is set, the next command will be executed during the same frame. This of course does not apply to the track commands.

In the following example, the first three commands are executed at the same time and the program will stay at the third step until next program step. on the next program step, the goto command will jump to the first command and execute it. in other words, the whole program will always be executed each program step.

|| {{{1 800c}}} || set arpeggio note to +12 semitones (8000 + 000c) || 
|| {{{| 9102}}} || portamento up by 2/256 semitones (8000 + 1102) || 
|| {{{| 0710}}} || pw down by 10 steps || 
|| {{{2 ff00}}} || go to beginning || 

The program can be edited by moving to the program and pressing return on the instruction you want to edit.

====Commands====

The commands are interchangeable between the track command and the program commands (where applicable). Most of the commands try to follow the "standards" set by Obarski's Soundtracker and later Protracker.

_{{{xx}}}, {{{yy}}} = parameter to command_

|| *Command* || *Description* ||
|| {{{00xx}}} || set arpeggio note (final played note = played note + arpeggio note + vibrato etc.) ||
|| {{{10xy}}}  || set external arpeggio notes (used with 00f0 and 00f1) ||
|| {{{01xx}}}  || portamento up ||
|| {{{02xx}}} || portamento down ||
|| {{{03xx}}} || slide to note with speed xx ||
|| {{{04xy}}} || vibrato with speed of x and depth of y ||
|| {{{11xx}}} || portamento up by one semitone ||
|| {{{12xx}}} || portamento down by one semitone ||
|| {{{21xx}}} || filter cutoff up ||
|| {{{22xx}}} || filter cutoff down ||
|| {{{07xx}}}  || pulse width down ||
|| {{{08xx}}} || pulse width up ||
|| {{{09xx}}} || set pulse width ||
|| {{{29xx}}} || set cutoff ||
|| {{{0axy}}} || Fade volume up by x, down by y ||
|| {{{0b0x}}} || set waveform (1 = noise, 2 = pulse, 4 = triangle, 8 = saw, 9 = 1 + 8 = noise + saw etc.) ||
|| {{{0cxx}}} || set volume ||
|| {{{0eax}}} || fine fade volume down by x ||
|| {{{0ebx}}} || fine fade volume up by x ||
|| {{{fd00}}} || loop begin ||
|| {{{fexx}}} || loop to previous "fd00" xx times ||
|| {{{ffxx}}} || go to step xx ||
|| {{{fffd}}} || trigger note release ||
|| {{{fffe}}} || nop (no operation) ||
|| {{{ffff}}} || end program ||

==Sequence editor==

{{{
pattern
 |  position offset
 |  |
01+01
}}}

In the above example the pattern position is not a multiple of sequence pattern step, thus the offset is shown. the note offset is set to a full octave, the played pattern will be played an octave above the actual notes and so on.

===Keyboard commands===

|| 0-9, a-z || enter pattern ||
|| ALT+up/down || adjust note offset ||
|| CTRL+down/up || edit song length ||
|| CTRL+left/right || edit sequence editor pattern step ||
|| insert/delete/backspace || do what you would expect ||
