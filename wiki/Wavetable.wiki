#summary Wavetable

= What's this? =

Basically, the wavetable makes it possible for an instrument to play an actual sample. It can be combined with the synth. A very simple use would be just to play a sampled instrument instead of chip sounds and a more complex example is to play a sampled "attack" combined with synth "release", MT-32-style.
