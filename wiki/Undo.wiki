#summary Help on the undo feature

Most editing actions in klystrack can be undoed. However, actions like loading a song, starting a new song and so on won't be undoable. Undo is available in the menu (Edit > Undo) or more easily by pressing {{{Ctrl-Z}}}. An undone action can be redone (redo) with {{{Ctrl-Y}}}.
