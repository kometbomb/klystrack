#summary How to customize klystrack

= Themes =

{{{res/data}}} contains several data files that can be changed to make klystrack look different. To create new data files, you need to use makebundle from the klystron tools.

==colors.txt==

This file contains the text colors. 

==bevel.bmp==

This is the main graphics file. The first row has different bevel (patterned rectangle) styles, the bottom row has button decals. The bevels generally have a 4 pixel wide border and a 8x8 center that is repeated.

==8x8.fnt, 7x6.fnt==

The fonts can be changed but it is recommended that they have the same dimensions as the originals.
