#summary How to use the music and sound effects in your own projects

klystrack songs and instruments can easily be used in the klystron library. For demos and intros, it is possible to use only the audio routines. See the [http://code.google.com/p/klystrack/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fplayer command line player example].

Please consult the [http://code.google.com/p/klystron/wiki/MakingNoise klystron manual] for more info.
