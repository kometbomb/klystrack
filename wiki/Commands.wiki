#summary Description of track and program commands

When a note is playing, an instrument program or the track data can modify various parameters by using commands.

The commands are interchangeable between the track commands and the program commands (where applicable). Most of the commands loosely follow the "standards" set by the original Soundtracker and later trackers.

The commands generally follow a pattern: the first two digits tell the action and the next two are the parameter(s) for the command.
