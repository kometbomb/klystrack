#summary Description of track and program commands

=Commands=

When a note is playing, an instrument program or the track data can modify various parameters by using commands.

The commands are interchangeable between the track commands and the program commands (where applicable). Most of the commands loosely follow the "standards" set by the original Soundtracker and later trackers.

The commands generally follow a pattern: the first two digits tell the action and the next two are the parameter(s) for the command. 

_{{{xx}}}, {{{yy}}} = parameter to command_

|| *Command* || *Description* ||
|| {{{00xx}}} || set arpeggio note (final played note = played note + arpeggio note + vibrato etc.) ||
|| {{{40xx}}} || set absolute arpeggio note (final played note = absolute arpeggio note + vibrato etc.) ||
|| {{{01xx}}}  || portamento up ||
|| {{{02xx}}} || portamento down ||
|| {{{03xx}}} || slide to note with speed xx ||
|| {{{04xy}}} || vibrato with speed of x and depth of y ||
|| {{{07xx}}}  || pulse width down ||
|| {{{08xx}}} || pulse width up ||
|| {{{09xx}}} || set pulse width ||
|| {{{0axy}}} || Fade volume up by x, down by y ||
|| {{{0b0x}}} || set waveform (1 = noise, 2 = pulse, 4 = triangle, 8 = saw, 9 = 1 + 8 = noise + saw etc.) ||
|| {{{0cxx}}} || set volume ||
|| {{{0dxx}}} || jump to pattern position xx (in current pattern only), makes pattern looping possible ||
|| {{{0e1x}}} || fine portamento up by x ||
|| {{{0e2x}}} || fine portamento down by x ||
|| {{{0e9x}}} || retrigger note every x tick ||
|| {{{0eax}}} || fine fade volume down by x ||
|| {{{0ebx}}} || fine fade volume up by x ||
|| {{{0ecx}}} || set volume to zero on tick x (note cut) ||
|| {{{0edx}}} || start playing current note on tick x (note delay) ||
|| {{{0fxy}}} || set play speeds to x and y. if x is 0, set both to y ||
|| {{{10xy}}} || set external arpeggio notes (used with 00f0 and 00f1 in the program) ||
|| {{{11xx}}} || portamento up by one semitone ||
|| {{{12xx}}} || portamento down by one semitone ||
|| {{{17xx}}} || slide panning to left by xx ||
|| {{{18xx}}} || set stereo panning to xx, 0 = left, 64 = center, 128 = right ||
|| {{{19xx}}} || slide panning to right by xx ||
|| {{{1axx}}} || fade global volume, works similar to 0axx ||
|| {{{1cxx}}} || set channel volume, works similar to 0cxx ||
|| {{{1dxx}}} || set global volume, works similar to 0cxx ||
|| {{{1fxx}}} || set play rate to xx ||
|| {{{21xx}}} || filter cutoff up ||
|| {{{22xx}}} || filter cutoff down ||
|| {{{29xx}}} || set cutoff ||
|| {{{2axx}}} || set resonance ||
|| {{{2bxx}}} || set filter type ||
|| {{{31xx}}} || slide buzz tuning up ||
|| {{{32xx}}} || slide buzz tuning down ||
|| {{{3f0x}}} || set buzz shape (0-3) ||
|| {{{39xx}}} || set buzz finetune (0x80 = 0, 0x00 = -128, 0xff = 127) ||
|| {{{3axx}}} || set buzz semitune (0x80 = 0, 0x00 = -128, 0xff = 127) ||
|| {{{5xxx}}} || start wavetable sample at offset xxx (0-fff) ||
|| {{{6xxx}}} || set fine cutoff frequency (0-7ff) ||
|| {{{7dxx}}} || restart instument program ||
|| {{{fd00}}} || loop begin ||
|| {{{fexx}}} || loop to previous "fd00" xx times ||
|| {{{ffxx}}} || go to step xx ||
|| {{{fffd}}} || trigger note release ||
|| {{{fffe}}} || nop (no operation) ||
|| {{{ffff}}} || end program ||


=Volume column commands=

The volume column can be used to trigger some commands in addition to setting the volume.

|| Dx || Fade volume down (same as command {{{0a0x}}} ||
|| Ux || Fade volume up (same as command {{{0ax0}}} ||
